Code for the paper [*Quantum Simulation on Noisy Superconducting Quantum Computers*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02795).

This experiment simulates the time evolution under a tight binding model on IBM Quantum hardware.
The documentation and code consists of one [notebook](docs/qsim-tight-binding-model.ipynb) that contains background information, shows how the building blocks of the experiment were implemented, collects experimental data, analyzes data, and generates plots.
